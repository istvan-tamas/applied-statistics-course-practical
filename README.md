# Solving the practical problems for applied statistics

## Used packages:

- using Distributions
- using StatsBase
- using HypothesisTests
- using Memoize
- using Statistics
- using Ranges

Solutions are in prog mode:

python.exe .\checker.py sol=.\problems\walk3\walk3.jl lang=julia problem=walk3 mode=prog

Hypothesis test are quite slow... and also the die2 problem, but the programs are running...
